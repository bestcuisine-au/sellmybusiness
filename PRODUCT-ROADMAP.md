**Primary Focus: SellMyBusiness.com.au**
- AI-powered FSBO platform
- Works for ALL industries (not just hospitality)
- No partnerships required
- Direct revenue from day one
- First mover advantage in AI-driven business sales

**Future Expansion: Industry Directories**
- HospitalityForSale.com.au
- RetailForSale.com.au
- TradesForSale.com.au
- (+ 10 more verticals)
- Feed traffic to SellMyBusiness
- Potential Arosoftware partnership (later)

### Why FSBO First

1. **No dependencies** — We control our destiny
2. **Direct revenue** — Owners pay us, not brokers
3. **AI differentiation** — No one else has this
4. **Scalable** — Same platform serves all industries
