## API & Integration Landscape

### Direct API Access: **Very Limited**

Most platforms do **NOT** offer public APIs for direct listing creation. Integration happens through:

#### 1. **Broker CRM Systems** (Primary Method)
The main path to API access is through specialized broker software:

**Arosoftware** (Business Broker CRM)
- **Key Integration Partner** for Australian business brokers
- Automatically uploads listings to **8 business broker specific websites + 40+ others**
- Confirmed integrations:
  - SEEK Business (custom API with full category/region mapping)
  - Likely: Bsale, CommercialRealEstate.com.au, AnyBusiness
- REA (realestate.com.au) API integration for ratings/reviews
- Mobile CRM app with full sync
- Website design + CRM integrated solution

**Access Method:**
- Become a business broker client of Arosoftware
- Pricing: Contact for broker packages
- 7-day free trial available

#### 2. **Domain Group APIs** (Agent-Only)
- Domain Commercial has established APIs
- Requires verified agent/agency account
- Rate Calculator API
- Property data integration
- Social media boost integration (Facebook)

#### 3. **Third-Party Solutions**
**Web Scraping (Read-Only):**
- Apify scrapers available for BizBuySell
- Hexomatic scraping recipes
- Not useful for listing creation

### Syndication Patterns

**How Brokers Syndicate:**
Most business brokers mention listing on "all major platforms":
- SEEK Business
- CommercialRealEstate.com.au
- Bsale
- BusinessForSale.com.au
- Domain Commercial
- AnyBusiness

This suggests:
1. Manual multi-posting, OR
2. Using Arosoftware or similar CRM tools
3. Likely some manual work still required per platform
